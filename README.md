# Backdoors & Trojans

## Introduction
This lab exercise involves understanding and utilizing backdoors and Trojans to gain unauthorized access to a computer system. You will use Tini as a backdoor program and mFileBinder as a wrapper program to create a backdoor Trojan horse. The lab is designed to provide insight into how backdoors and Trojans work and the potential vulnerabilities they exploit.

## Before You Begin
- Set up the Windows Server 2008 as the victim computer and Windows 7 as the hacker computer.
- Ensure both virtual machines are on the same subnet and have IP addresses assigned.
- Understand the importance of ethical hacking and ensure all activities are conducted in a controlled environment.

## Setting Up the Lab
1. **Assign IP Addresses**: Assign `10.81.10.1` to the hacker computer and `10.81.10.2` to the victim computer.
2. **Network Configuration**: Configure both computers' network adapters to Host-only.
3. **User Account Setup**: On the victim computer, create a user account with your FOL username and assign administrator privileges.

## Lab Procedure & Screenshots

### Exploit #1: Backdoor Access with Tini
- **Objective**: Gain backdoor access to the victim computer using Tini.
- **Execution**: Execute Tini on the victim computer and connect from the hacker computer using telnet.
- **Screenshot 1**: Take a screen capture showing the Task Manager window Processes tab (Tini & cmd.exe).

### Exploit #2: Directory Listing via Backdoor
- **Objective**: Verify the backdoor connection and access to the victim's file system.
- **Execution**: Use the telnet connection to list the contents of the directory where Tini resides.
- **Screenshot 3**: Take a screen capture of the directory listing in the command prompt.

### Exploit #3: Verifying Connection
- **Objective**: Confirm that the backdoor connection has been established from the hacker's computer.
- **Execution**: Use the netstat command on the victim computer to verify an established connection.
- **Screenshot 4**: Take a screen capture of the netstat command ensuring the process id (PID) is included.

### Exploit #4: Persistent Access via Startup
- **Objective**: Ensure persistent backdoor access by adding Tini to the startup menu.
- **Execution**: Copy Tini to the startup directory of the victim computer and restart.
- **Screenshot 5**: Take a screen capture of Task Manager showing your user name as the owner of tini.exe.

### Exploit #5: Creating and Using a Trojan Horse
- **Objective**: Create and execute a Trojan horse combining Tini with a benign program.
- **Execution**: Use mFileBinder to bind Tini with felix.exe, run the bound file, and verify Tini is listening.
- **Screenshot 6**: Take a screen capture that shows the netstat â€“nao | find "7777" command output and also shows felix on the desktop.
